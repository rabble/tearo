			<div class="content astro-NZWNDKQD"><p>If Wellington made its the Te Aro downtown car-free, it would be a more pedestrian-friendly and sustainable place. People would be able to walk or ride bikes more easily, and the air would be cleaner without all the car exhaust. This would also create more opportunities for businesses, as people would be more likely to window shop or stop in if they were just out for a walk. Ultimately, a car-free downtown would be a more livable space for everyone.</p>
<p>Te Aro already is a bustling hub of activity, filled with people walking to and from work, running errands, and enjoying a night out. This is in stark contrast to the surrounding suburban and rural areas, which are much more spread out and car-dependent. Making the downtown area car-free would have a number of benefits for both the city and its residents.</p>
<p>For one, it would help to reduce traffic congestion and pollution in the Te Aro area. With fewer cars on the road, there would be less traffic jams and a smaller carbon footprint. This would be beneficial for both the environment and the people who live and work in the downtown area.</p>
<p>Another benefit of making the downtown area car-free is that it would encourage people to walk more. Walking is a great form of exercise, and it would be a way for people to get around the downtown area without having to worry about finding a parking spot. This would also free up parking spaces for people who live in the downtown area and need a place to park their car.</p>
<p>Overall, making the downtown area car-free would have a number of benefits for the city and its residents. It would reduce traffic and pollution, and encourage people to walk more. This would create a healthier and more enjoyable downtown area for everyone.</p></div>
