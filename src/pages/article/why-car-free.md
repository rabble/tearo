Wellington is taking its first bold step toward a car-free future with the Golden Mile transformation. This vital project will turn Lambton Quay, Willis Street, Manners Street, and Courtenay Place into people-first spaces, removing private vehicles and creating wider footpaths, dedicated bus lanes, and spaces for people to gather and enjoy the city.

But this should be just the beginning. The success of the Golden Mile project can catalyze a broader transformation of Te Aro into a truly car-free district. Cities worldwide have shown that removing cars from city centers creates more vibrant, healthy, and economically successful urban spaces:

- **Paris** is removing 70,000 parking spaces and creating a "15-minute city" where everything you need is within walking distance
- **Barcelona** has created "superblocks" that prioritize pedestrians and cyclists
- **Oslo** has removed nearly all parking from its city center, leading to increased retail activity
- **Copenhagen** has been gradually pedestrianizing its center since the 1960s, creating one of the world's most livable cities

Te Aro is perfectly positioned to follow these examples. With its compact layout, diverse mix of businesses, and existing public transport connections, we can create a neighborhood where:

- Streets become places for people to gather, not just move through
- Local businesses thrive with increased foot traffic
- Air quality improves dramatically
- Children can safely play and move around independently
- Public transport runs more efficiently without car congestion
- Culture and community flourish in our public spaces

The Golden Mile project proves that Wellington is ready for change. Let's build on this momentum and transform Te Aro into a model for sustainable urban living in Aotearoa New Zealand.
