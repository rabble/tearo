## What is a Living Street?

Living streets (or "woonerfs") are shared spaces where pedestrians have priority, but vehicles aren't completely banned. They're designed to make cars feel like guests, moving slowly and carefully through a pedestrian-dominated environment.

## Why They Work for Te Aro

Te Aro's narrow streets and mixed-use character make it perfect for living streets:

- **Existing Examples**: Lower Cuba Street shows how it works
- **Dense Mixed Use**: Lots of destinations close together
- **Historic Character**: Preserved by slower traffic
- **Community Need**: High pedestrian demand

## Design Elements

Successful living streets include:

1. **No Curbs**: Single-level surfaces from building to building
2. **Different Paving**: Materials that signal shared space
3. **Chicanes**: Curved driving paths to slow vehicles
4. **Street Furniture**: Benches, planters, bike parking
5. **Play Areas**: Safe spaces for children
6. **Loading Zones**: Designated times for deliveries

## Proposed Streets for Conversion

Priority streets for living street conversion:

- **Ghuznee Street**: Connecting Cuba and Victoria
- **Vivian Street**: After SH1 removal
- **Left Bank**: Extending Cuba Mall's success
- **Frederick Street**: Linking apartments to shops
- **Holland Street**: Creating quiet neighborhood spaces

## Benefits for Everyone

Living streets create multiple advantages:

- **Businesses**: More foot traffic and outdoor space
- **Residents**: Quieter, safer neighborhoods
- **Children**: Safe play areas
- **Elderly**: Easy walking without curbs
- **Cyclists**: Safe shared spaces
- **Drivers**: Maintained essential access

## Implementation Strategy

How to create living streets in Te Aro:

1. **Start Small**: Trial with temporary materials
2. **Gather Data**: Measure usage and impacts
3. **Engage Users**: Work with residents and businesses
4. **Phase Changes**: Gradual implementation
5. **Adjust Design**: Respond to community feedback

## Examples from Other Cities

Successful living streets worldwide:

- **Amsterdam**: The original woonerf concept
- **Auckland**: Fort Street shared space
- **Melbourne**: Little Streets project
- **London**: Exhibition Road
- **Copenhagen**: Str√∏get area expansion
