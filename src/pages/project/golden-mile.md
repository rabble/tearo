## What is the Golden Mile Project?

The Golden Mile transformation is Wellington's most ambitious street redesign project, converting our main shopping streets - Lambton Quay, Willis Street, Manners Street, and Courtenay Place - into people-first spaces. This $85 million project will fundamentally change how we use our city center.

## Key Changes Coming

- **No Private Vehicles**: The entire route will be bus and active transport only
- **Wider Footpaths**: More space for walking, dining, and street life
- **Dedicated Bus Lanes**: Faster, more reliable public transport
- **New Public Spaces**: Areas for gathering, events, and relaxation
- **Better Cycling Access**: Safe routes through the city center
- **More Street Trees**: Adding greenery and shade

## Timeline and Implementation

1. **2024**: Initial work begins on Lambton Quay
2. **2025**: Willis Street and Manners Street transformation
3. **2026**: Courtenay Place redesign
4. **2027**: Project completion and activation

## Why This Matters for Te Aro

The Golden Mile project proves that Wellington is ready for car-free spaces. Its success will demonstrate that:

- Businesses can thrive without car access
- Public transport becomes more efficient
- Street life improves dramatically
- People prefer walking-friendly spaces

## Learning from the Process

The Golden Mile transformation offers valuable lessons for expanding car-free areas:

- **Community Engagement**: How to bring people along
- **Business Adaptation**: Supporting changes in access
- **Design Solutions**: Solving practical challenges
- **Public Support**: Building momentum for change

## Next Steps Beyond the Golden Mile

The project creates momentum for broader changes in Te Aro:

1. Extending pedestrian priority to connecting streets
2. Creating a network of living streets
3. Removing more on-street parking
4. Adding bicycle infrastructure
5. Expanding public transport priority
