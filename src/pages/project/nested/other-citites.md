There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_car-free_places">hundreds of car free cities</a> across the world. 
Now major cities like <a href="fastcompany.com/90456075/here-are-11-more-neighborhoods-that-have-joined-the-car-free-revolution">Amsterdam, 
Birmingham, Brussels, and Helsinki</a> are making their downtowns car free. Life is better 
<a href="https://talkwellington.org.nz/2022/what-happens-when-a-city-really-bans-cars/">when we ban cars</a>. 

Across the world there's <a href="https://parkingreform.org/">a movement to reclaim our streets</a>, take space that's used for parking and turn it over to people as a new public space. Parking needs to be limited and expensive while public transporation should provided at no cost to the passenger.
