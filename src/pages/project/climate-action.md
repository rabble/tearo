## Te Aro's Carbon Challenge

Wellington has declared a climate emergency, but our streets still prioritize high-emission transport:

- 40% of Wellington's emissions come from transport
- Most Te Aro street space is dedicated to cars
- Current layout encourages driving for short trips
- Parking encourages private vehicle use

## The Car-Free Climate Solution

Converting Te Aro to car-free and living streets would:

1. **Reduce Direct Emissions**
   - Fewer vehicles in the city center
   - Less idling and searching for parking
   - More efficient public transport

2. **Enable Low-Carbon Choices**
   - Make walking and cycling safer
   - Improve public transport efficiency
   - Support micro-mobility options

3. **Create Climate Resilience**
   - More space for trees and plants
   - Better stormwater management
   - Reduced heat island effect
   - Community gathering spaces

## Measuring the Impact

Research shows car-free areas reduce emissions through:

- **Mode Shift**: 30-60% reduction in car trips
- **Public Transport**: 20-40% faster bus journeys
- **Green Space**: 10-30% increase in tree cover
- **Building Energy**: 2-8% reduction in cooling needs

## Wellington's Climate Goals

Car-free Te Aro supports Wellington's climate commitments:

- Net zero carbon by 2050
- 60% reduction in transport emissions by 2030
- 40% increase in active transport mode share
- 100% increase in public transport use

## Co-Benefits of Climate Action

Climate-friendly streets deliver multiple benefits:

- **Health**: Cleaner air and more active lifestyles
- **Economic**: Reduced infrastructure costs
- **Social**: More community interaction
- **Environmental**: Better biodiversity and water quality
- **Resilience**: Stronger local communities

## Taking Action

How to support climate-friendly streets:

1. **Support the Golden Mile** project
2. **Advocate** for car-free zones
3. **Use and celebrate** existing car-free spaces
4. **Share knowledge** about climate benefits
5. **Engage** with council consultations
