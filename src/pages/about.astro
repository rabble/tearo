					TeAro.org advocates for expanding Wellington's car-free vision beyond the Golden Mile transformation. While the Golden Mile project is an exciting first step in prioritizing people over cars, we believe Te Aro can become a model for sustainable urban living in Aotearoa New Zealand.
				</p>
				<p>
					This website is a project of <a href="https://evan.henshaw-plath.com">Evan Henshaw-Plath</a>, a web developer and activist who envisions a more equitable and sustainable Wellington. Based in Mt Victoria, P≈çneke, he sees the potential for Te Aro to join the global movement of cities reclaiming their streets for people.
				</p>
				<p>
					While Wellington has made progress with projects like the Cuba Street mall and now the Golden Mile transformation, most of Te Aro remains dominated by cars and parking. This prevents our community from using public space in ways that enhance life, culture, and business activity.
				</p>
				<p>
					We advocate for:
					- Extending car-free zones beyond the Golden Mile
					- Removing on-street parking except for mobility permit holders and essential deliveries
					- Creating a network of living streets and pedestrian zones
					- Prioritizing public transport and active mobility
					- Adding more trees, seating, and public spaces
				</p>
				<p>
					Cities worldwide are proving that car-free centers work. Wellington can too.
