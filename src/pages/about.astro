				<h2>Why Car-Free Cities Matter</h2>
				<p>
					Cities around the world are recognizing that being designed around cars rather than people has created numerous problems:
				</p>
				
				<h3>Climate Impact</h3>
				<p>
					Transportation is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. In Wellington, road transport accounts for over 34% of our emissions. Creating car-free zones is one of the most effective ways to reduce our climate impact while making the city more resilient to climate change.
				</p>

				<h3>Public Health</h3>
				<p>
					Car-dominated cities contribute to:
					<ul>
						<li>Poor air quality and respiratory issues</li>
						<li>Reduced physical activity and obesity</li>
						<li>Traffic accidents and deaths</li>
						<li>Noise pollution and stress</li>
						<li>Social isolation and mental health impacts</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h3>Social Equity</h3>
				<p>
					Car-centric planning creates inequity:
					<ul>
						<li>Cars and parking take up valuable public space that could be used for housing, parks, or community facilities</li>
						<li>Car ownership is expensive and excludes many people from fully participating in city life</li>
						<li>Children, elderly, and disabled people often can't drive but still need to navigate the city</li>
						<li>Low-income neighborhoods often bear the worst impacts of traffic and pollution</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h3>Economic Benefits</h3>
				<p>
					Car-free areas consistently show economic advantages:
					<ul>
						<li>Increased foot traffic for local businesses</li>
						<li>Higher property values</li>
						<li>Reduced infrastructure maintenance costs</li>
						<li>More efficient use of valuable urban land</li>
						<li>Greater attraction for tourists and visitors</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>Why Te Aro?</h2>
				<p>
					Te Aro is perfectly positioned to become a car-free district:
					<ul>
						<li>Compact, walkable layout</li>
						<li>High density of residents and businesses</li>
						<li>Excellent public transport connections</li>
						<li>Strong existing pedestrian culture</li>
						<li>Success of Cuba Street as a car-free zone</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>Our Vision</h2>
				<p>
					TeAro.org advocates for expanding Wellington's car-free vision beyond the Golden Mile transformation. While the Golden Mile project is an exciting first step in prioritizing people over cars, we believe Te Aro can become a model for sustainable urban living in Aotearoa New Zealand.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This website is a project of <a href="https://evan.henshaw-plath.com">Evan Henshaw-Plath</a>, a web developer and activist who envisions a more equitable and sustainable Wellington. Based in Mt Victoria, P≈çneke, he sees the potential for Te Aro to join the global movement of cities reclaiming their streets for people.
				</p>

				<h2>What We Advocate For</h2>
				<p>
					Our key proposals include:
					<ul>
						<li>Extending car-free zones beyond the Golden Mile</li>
						<li>Removing on-street parking except for mobility permit holders and essential deliveries</li>
						<li>Creating a network of living streets and pedestrian zones</li>
						<li>Prioritizing public transport and active mobility</li>
						<li>Adding more trees, seating, and public spaces</li>
						<li>Implementing low-traffic neighborhoods</li>
						<li>Supporting bike and scooter share systems</li>
						<li>Improving accessibility for all users</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>Join the Movement</h2>
				<p>
					Cities worldwide are proving that car-free centers work. From Oslo to Paris, Barcelona to Copenhagen, the evidence is clear: when we prioritize people over cars, everyone benefits. Wellington can join these forward-thinking cities in creating a more livable, sustainable, and vibrant urban environment.
